A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NPpPgq.

 I'm back with more of them moving circles. This script uses getImageData to form the text with particles. You can do some fun stuff with text and Canvas this way.
Once again I'm using createjs for Canvas manipulation and the greensock library for easy tweening.

Forked from [Rachel Smith](http://codepen.io/rachsmith/)'s Pen [Circles, text and getImageData](http://codepen.io/rachsmith/pen/fBoiD/).
